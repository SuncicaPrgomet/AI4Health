This solution represents AI algorithms developed for early prediction of patient rehospitalization following discharge from the hospital. They utilize artificial intelligence to analyze clinical data and identify patients at high risk of readmission within 30 days. The goal is to reduce healthcare costs and enhance the quality of the healthcare system. These solutions were developed as participants in the AI4Health.Cro Innovation Competition 2024 in Croatia.
